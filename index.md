## Create a simple register form

### Requirements

1. Use React / node to serve the form on GET http://localhost/register
2. On submit should make a POST call to http://localhost/register
3. The Node http://localhost/register API should accept the payload and respond back with a success message
4. On success the UI should show the success message

### Bounty Points

1. Form is ADA compliant
2. Disabling JS on Browser should not impact the functionality
3. Regex is implmeneted for the fields

### Sample form
